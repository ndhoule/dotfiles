# Nathan Houle's dotfiles

Configuration files zsh, vim, and tmux. Also a petty excuse to learn git.

I use these dotfiles on Arch Linux and FreeBSD, but they'll probably work just fine
on OS X, too.


## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal to clone and set up the dotfiles. Feel
free to substitute the ~/projects directory with one of your choice.

```terminal
mkdir -p ~/projects
git clone git@github.com:ndhoule/dotfiles.git ~/projects/dotfiles
cd ~/projects/dotfiles
sh bootstrap.sh
```
